## A data visualization cloud enabled system.
* We introduce a system that recommends interesting visualizations which helps data
scientists and analysts connecting things in interesting ways and look at data from different
angles.
* The system operates on a large scale unstructured data distributed over a cluster in which
storage devices are not all attached to a common processor and doesn't reside in a
traditional row-column database, it may include word-processor documents, the body of
emails and many other kinds of business documents, Our system then takes these data and
converts it into structured data as those in any DBMS which resides in a fixed field to be
simple and easy to use, later we run our many operations on top of this dataset.
* The system tackles the problem of identifying and showing the appropriate type of visual
according to some userâ€™s input so we help them understand what they want from the data
easily.
* Then our system works as recommendation engine which intelligently recommends
visualizations which are most interesting and useful.
